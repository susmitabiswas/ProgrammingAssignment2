## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do
## These functions introduce a special matrix object which caches its inverse.
## The create such a special matrix m you execute \code{m <- makeCacheMatrix(x)}
## where x is an ordinary matrix. You can then get the value with \code{m$get()}
## and change the value with \code{m$set(y)} where y is an ordinary matrix.
## You can get the inverse with \code{cacheSolve(m)}.


#' Create a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

## Write a short comment describing this function
#' Return inverse of matrix x
#' 
#' This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
#' makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated 
#' (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve retrieves the 
#' inverse from the cache.
#' 
#' @param x a special matrix created with makeCacheMatrix
#' 
#' @return The inverse of the matrix x
#' 
cacheSolve <- function(x) {
  m <- x$getInverse() # This fetches the cached value for the inverse
  if(!is.null(m)) { # If the cache was not empty, we can just return it
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  # The cache was empty. We need to calculate it, cache it, and then return it.
  data <- x$get()  # Get value of matrix
  m <- solve(data) # Calculate inverse
  x$setInverse(m)  # Cache the result
  m                # Return the inverse
}
